# Project Overview

Create test suites using Jasmine for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. This is part of a "test-driven development" approach.

## What I learned

1) How to set up and run basic unit test.
2) How to configure test using Jasmine 2.0.0 (https://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html).
3) Testing asynchronous operations. Including the use of **beforeEach** and **done()**.
4) Using **matchers** to compare actual values and expected values.
5) Understianing and utilizing DOM and CSS elements to serve as hooks for the testing environment.

## Files included

The basic files, not including the test suites in the feedreader.js, were all provided by Udacity for the Font-end class "FeedReader"
Index(**./index.html**), 
CSS (**./css/style.css**), including iconmoon and normalize,
Fonts (**./fonts/iconmoon...**),
JavaScript (**./js/app.js**), and 
Jasmine Specs (**./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js**) 

# How to run this project

1) Download the testfeeder files to your local computer.
2) Open index.html on a server of choice.
3) Marvel at the intrepid abilities of this little feedreader testing environment!
